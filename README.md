# Fundraising activity that promotes donations online via giving beer as a 'thank-you'.
## Summary
Online donations received from 'locals' (only Victorians) in exchange for beer that is 'home-brewed'. Delivery of this beer to locals (via bicycle) as 'thank you' for donation. Development of beer quality will continue until commercially competitive.

## Beer brewing
Home-brewed beer using high-quality Australian ingredients. Brewed on a small micro-scale basis that allows quick iteration towards a quality beer, in addition to allowing donator input. Experimentation of process and/or ingredients to achieve unique & interesting beer will be prioritised.

## Donating online
Website that allows donation via Credit or Debit Card. Fully-secure, using trusted and verified 3rd-party service providers, while our website holds no financial data of any kind of any donor. 

## Where does the money go?
All financial money raised will be donated to specific charities that we believe have higher cost-effectiveness, where the problem to be addressed is more often ignored due to lack of emotional connection between the donator and the cause.
